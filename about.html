        <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; font-style: italic; color: var(--deep-burgundy); margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            "We started with nothing but a grill, a dream, and a whole lot of beef."

    <!-- Origin Story -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="wings">In the Beginning, There Was Hunger</h2>
        <p>
            It all started on a fateful Tuesday in 2019 when Daniel Rodriguez had what can only be described 
            as a burger epiphany. After yet another disappointing fast-food experience that left his soul 
            as empty as his wallet, Daniel looked up at the sky and made a sacred vow: "There has to be 
            a better way to burger."
        </p>
        <p>
            That very night, Daniel claims he had a dream where a chorus of angels (who looked suspiciously 
            like his grandmother) taught him the secret to the perfect burger. When he woke up, he found 
            a mysterious recipe scribbled on his nightstand in what appeared to be golden ink. Skeptics 
            say it was just a regular pen, but Daniel knows divine intervention when he sees it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Armed with this heavenly knowledge and a secondhand grill he named "Gabriel," Daniel began 
            his mission to bring burger salvation to the masses. What started as weekend cookouts for 
            friends quickly became a neighborhood phenomenon, with people lining up for blocks just to 
            taste what they called "miracle burgers."

                <p>
                    We're not just serving food; we're spreading the good word about what a burger 
                    can truly be. Every customer who leaves our restaurant becomes a burger missionary, 
                    telling others about the divine experience they just had. It's not a cult, we swear.

                <h3>Quality Justice</h3>
                <p>
                    In a world plagued by soggy buns and flavorless patties, we stand as righteous 
                    warriors fighting the good fight against mediocre burgers. Every ingredient is 
                    judged by the highest standards, and we show no mercy to subpar produce.

                <h3>Culinary Miracles</h3>
                <p>
                    We believe that the perfect burger is more than food ‚Äì it's a transcendent experience. 
                    Our goal is to create moments of pure joy, one bite at a time. If you don't tear up 
                    a little when eating our burgers, we're not doing our job right.

            <p>
                Our grill masters undergo a rigorous training program that some say borders on the mystical. 
                They learn to read the burger's aura, to understand the precise moment when a patty reaches 
                enlightenment, and to channel their inner zen while flipping. The result? Burgers that are 
                seared to perfection with the precision of a Swiss watch and the soul of a poet.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--deep-burgundy); font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">ü•¨ Ingredients Blessed by Time</h3>
            <p>
                We don't just source ingredients; we form relationships with them. Our lettuce is so fresh 
                it's still gossiping about the other vegetables. Our tomatoes are picked at the exact moment 
                they reach peak happiness, and our onions are so perfectly caramelized they could make a 
                grown man weep tears of joy (not just from the onion fumes).

            <p>
                Our team isn't just staff ‚Äì they're a carefully assembled group of burger disciples who 
                share our vision of culinary perfection. Each member has been personally trained by Daniel 
                himself and has sworn a solemn oath to never let a subpar burger leave the kitchen. They're 
                like the Avengers, but with aprons and a deep understanding of flavor profiles.
            </p>

            <p>
                We've designed our restaurant to feel like the kind of place where angels would grab a 
                quick bite between miracles. The atmosphere is warm, welcoming, and filled with the kind 
                of positive energy that makes you want to hug strangers and tip your server generously. 
                It's comfort food in the most comfortable environment imaginable.
